## What is Hiave? 
Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure tool to process structured data in Hadoop. It resides on top of Hadoop to summarize Big Data, and makes querying and analyzing easy.

## What is Hadoop? 
Hadoop is an open-source framework to store and process Big Data in a distributed environment. It contains two modules, one is MapReduce and another is Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).



MapReduce: It is a parallel programming model for processing large amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data on large clusters of commodity hardware.

HDFS:Hadoop Distributed File System is a part of Hadoop framework, used to store and process the datasets. It provides a fault-tolerant file system to run on commodity hardware.

The Hadoop ecosystem contains different sub-projects (tools) such as Sqoop, Pig, and Hive that are used to help Hadoop modules.

Sqoop: It is used to import and export data to and from between HDFS and RDBMS.

Pig: It is a procedural language platform used to develop a script for MapReduce operations.

Hive: It is a platform used to develop SQL type scripts to do MapReduce operations.


## Features of Hive
* Stores schema in a database and processed data into HDFS.
* Designed for OLAP.
* Provides SQL type language for querying called HiveQL or HQL.
* It is familiar, fast, scalable, and extensible.
